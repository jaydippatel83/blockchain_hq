**BlockchainHQ** is a Web3 hub for developers to ask questions, learn, and earn for their contributions.

The problem we're solving is simple: in current tech forums, developers who help the community by answering questions only receive "upvotes" or "reputation" as rewards. The real economic value goes to the forums, leaving the contributors with little to gain.

At BlockchainHQ, developers can ask questions and help others by providing answers. For their contributions and willingness to support fellow devs, they’ll earn EDU tokens as a reward.

Our platform also includes a marketplace with an escrow system. Here, anyone can post gigs or job opportunities for Web3 developers without paying high fees to freelancing platforms. They can post their requirements, lock payment in an escrow contract, and once the work is completed, tokens are released to the freelancer.

**Benefits of BlockchainHQ:**

**Real Value for Contributors**: Developers earn EDU tokens for their contributions instead of just receiving likes or upvotes, which hold no real-world value.

**No hefty Commissions to freelancing platforms**: Our marketplace is powered by smart contracts, eliminating the hefty commissions charged by traditional freelancing platforms.

**Growth of EDU Token Ecosystem**: The EDU token and Educhain ecosystem create a sustainable incentive structure to attract and support new developers.
